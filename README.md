# NFL-Big-Data-Bowl-by-Practicum

## Introduction

This report summarizes the results of an educational project in which a group of students from Practicum worked on a Kaggle competition to analyze player tracking data. The goal of the project was to simulate real work in a data science team and provide the students with hands-on experience in the field.

## Explanation of the project

The project was designed to give the students an opportunity to apply their data science skills and knowledge in a practical setting. Most of the students had only been studying data science for a few months and were able to contribute to the project despite having different levels of expertise. The projects undertaken by the students ranged from more toy-like exercises to more serious works with a good chance of winning the competition. These projects differed in their methods and technologies, as well as in their purpose and direction of research.

## Team structure and approach

Throughout the project, the students worked as a team with the goal of generating insights and new statistics from the player tracking data. The team structure was designed to mimic the dynamics of a real data science team, with the students working as new hires under the guidance of a team lead (the instructor). This approach allowed the students to learn what it is like to work in a professional data science team and understand the differences between the roles of a teacher and a team lead.

## Duration and meetings

The project lasted for about a month and included weekly meetings to discuss progress and address any issues that arose. During these meetings, the students were given the opportunity to present their work and receive feedback from the instructor and their peers.

## Student responsibilities

Each student was responsible for developing their own project within the scope of the Kaggle competition. This required them to formulate their own ideas, implement them in code, and evaluate the results. The students were given the freedom to explore different approaches and techniques, which allowed them to learn how to think creatively and critically about data science problems.

## Code review

In addition to working on their own projects, the students also participated in code reviews of their peers' work. This provided them with the opportunity to learn from each other and improve their coding skills. Code review is an important aspect of professional data science work, as it allows team members to identify and fix errors, as well as share knowledge and best practices.

## Conclusion

Overall, the project was a valuable learning experience for the students. It provided them with the opportunity to apply their data science skills in a real-world setting and learn from each other through code review and collaboration. The students were able to contribute to the project despite their different levels of expertise and learned how to formulate and evaluate their own ideas. The project also gave them a taste of what it is like to work in a professional data science team and understand the differences between the roles of a teacher and a team lead.

**Bellow you can find a list of all projects with a short description**

1. *"Linebackers - Spin to Win!"*

What makes the best linebackers the best? General answers would include game IQ, size, and speed. While speed and acceleration are well-studied, rotational movements and ability to change direction are not as well understood. A linebacker's ability to move their feet quickly and zigzag around linemen can be key to effectively getting to the ball and stopping the offensive play. In our study of linebacker pass rush movement, we found statistical evidence that in order to complete a successful pass rush, a linebacker needs to move faster, rotate more, and change direction more. From player-specific data, we found that the best linebackers are those who are able to generate enough momentum (defined as the product of weight and acceleration) and demonstrate better rotational movements than their colleagues in this position.

2. *How fast you get tired? The influence of weight on stamina*

Which American football players have the highest average speed? And how does the weight of the player affect the average speed and maximum acceleration? When examining the data, a statistically significant relationship was shown between the weight of the players and the average speed, as well as the maximum acceleration. From the player data, we found that heavier weight players (>110kg) run slower than players in other weight classes. Based on this, we can conclude that the desired weight of a player in the WR and TE positions is not more than 100 kg.

3. *Decision time matters*

Hurry is a situation when the QB is forced to throw the ball earlier than intended or is chased around/out of the pocket as the result of defensive pressure. To prevent this, the offensive line protects the passer, providing precious seconds to find receivers downfield. In our study of player movement data, we found statistical evidence that as the time a quarterback takes to make a decision decreases, the likelihood of a successful pass rises up.

4. *What influences the choice of scheme*

This project aims to study the performance of different coverage schemes in American football defense. The focus is on how factors such as defender strikes, hurries, sacks, types of blocks, and the number of defenders near the scrimmage affect the scheme. The project will analyze data from pff_passCoverage and identify trends and patterns in the relationship between these factors and the result of the pass. The goal is to determine which actions and events have the greatest impact on the game scheme.

5. *The most successful strategy of central linemen*

Before every play, linemen make a decision which type of blocking to choose. We need to decide which type of blocking is successful. For this research, we will examine the center linemen only, and we will see in which zone field effective types of blocking were dominating. We will divide a football field in four zones for this purpose.

6. *How does age affect speed and acceleration?*

The project aims to study the influence of age on player speed in American football. The focus is on older players, and the goal is to understand how age affects their performance. The project will analyze player data to identify any trends or patterns in the relationship between age and speed. The findings of the project may be useful for coaches and team managers in assessing the performance of older players and determining strategies for optimizing their speed and endurance.

7. *BMI and player performance*

The goal of this project is to study the relationship between a player's body mass index (BMI) and their performance as measured by binary indicators in the pff dataset. The hypothesis is that players with certain BMI values may have a higher frequency of positive indicator reactions. To test this hypothesis, the project will analyze player data and evaluate the relationship between BMI and indicator reactions. The findings of the project may be useful for coaches and team managers in understanding the impact of a player's BMI on their performance and determining strategies for optimizing their physical condition.

8. *The impact of colleges on American football*

The goal of this project was to investigate the relationship between football players and the colleges they attended. The focus was on understanding whether certain colleges have a tendency to graduate players to certain positions. The project also aimed to explore why Michigan University has a higher number of heavyweight players compared to other colleges. The findings of the project may be of interest to football coaches, team managers, and players looking to understand the factors that influence the development of football players and the distribution of talent across colleges.

9. *Bonus: Data [Anti] Science: The best college canteen*

The goal of this project is to identify the college with the best dining facilities. The focus is on finding the college that consistently ranks the highest in terms of dining quality and variety. To accomplish this, we are going to use statistical analysis to evaluate the data. The findings of the project may provide insight into which colleges are doing the best job of meeting the dining needs and preferences of their students.
